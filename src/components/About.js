      <p className="aboutMe">
        I'm a software engineer focused on roles in product management and
        technical roles that allow for business decision making. My passion is
        strategy and problem solving by fully leveraging good communication
        skills to build relationships across the companies I've worked for. I
        dig into the details when needed and create strategies to maintain and
        grow businesses based on my insight.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve managed areas of businesses worth over $100million. I’ve turned
        would be exit businesses to company initiatives while also training
        others to do the same based on the application of strategic thinking.
        <br />
        <br />I am the type of person who continues learning, who reaches out
        for collaboration, who is always looking for ways to bring wins to the
        companies, and who loves driving results by being clear with product
        vision.
